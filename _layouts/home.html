  <h3>“<a href="">For What It’s Worth: Measuring Land Value in the Era of Big Data and Machine Learning</a>”</h3>

<p class="abstract">
ABSTRACT:<br>
We adapt a machine learning method to provide new estimates for land valuation in the United
States, pairing this approach with “big data” from Zillow. Because this data includes detailed
information from hundreds of millions of property transactions covering much of the US, the
heterogeneous nature of this data serves as fertile ground for highlighting some of the practical
limitations of linear hedonic regression techniques for land valuation, a common method for mass
appraisal of land. We first construct traditional hedonic estimates of land value at the parcel-level
for most of the US as a baseline, focusing on single-family residential properties in our initial
analysis. We then modify the hedonic approach by using a machine learning method, gradient
boosting trees, for comparison. The results demonstrate how a machine learning approach can
more effectively address issues of sparse data with spatial controls or thin cells at fine levels of geography (like census tracts or block groups). Our initial estimates also show that the machine learning method offers a substantial improvement in prediction of single-family sale prices (i.e., a 75% reduction in RMSE, on average) and great potential for further applications in constructing aggregate measures of land value beyond the cases we pilot here.</p>

  <h3>“<a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ahlfeldg/WP/GA_SH_TS_-_HPI.pdf">Micro-geographic property price and rent indices</a>”</h3>

<p class="abstract">
ABSTRACT:<br>
We develop a programming algorithm that predicts a balanced-panel mix-adjusted house price index for arbitrary spatial units from repeated cross-sections of geocoded micro data. The algorithm combines parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques to provide a tight local fit where the underlying micro data are abundant and reliable extrapolations where data are sparse. To illustrate the functionality, we generate a panel of German property prices and rents that is unprecedented in its spatial coverage and detail. This novel data set uncovers a battery of stylized facts that motivate further research, e.g. on the density bias of price-to-rent ratios in levels and trends, within and between cities. Our method lends itself to the creation of comparable neighborhood-level qualified rent indices (Mietspiegel) across Germany.

  <h3>“<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3689632">A Machine Learning Approach to Price Indices:  Applications in Commercial Real Estate</a>”</h3>

<p class="abstract">
ABSTRACT:<br>
This article presents a model agnostic methodology for producing property price indices.The motivation to develop this methodology is to include non-linear and non-parametric models,  such  as  Machine  Learning  (ML),  in  the  pool  of  algorithms  to  produce  price  indices. The  key  innovation  is  the  use  of  individual  out-of-time  prediction  errors  to measure price changes. The data used in this study consist of 29,998 commercial real estate transactions in New York, in the period 2000–2019.  The results indicate that the prediction accuracy is higher for the ML models compared to linear models. On the other hand, ML algorithms depend more on the data used for calibration;  they produce less stable results when applied to small samples and may exhibit estimation bias. Hence,measures to reduce or eliminate bias need to be implemented, taking into consideration the bias and variance trade-off.</p>
