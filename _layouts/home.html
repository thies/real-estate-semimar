<h3>“Public Responses to COVID-19 Case Disclosure and Their Spatial Implications”</h3>

<p class="abstract">
ABSTRACT:<br> During the COVID-19 pandemic, a few countries chose to disclose detailed location information of cases, along with mass testing and contact tracing, rather than a lockdown policy. In this paper, we study public responses to this information by using daily mobility and credit card transaction data in Seoul, South Korea. We first find that the disclosure of COVID-19 cases did help promote voluntary precautionary behavior as both non-resident in-flow and retail spending decreased significantly in neighborhoods with more cases. But, public responses to the disclosed information of cases do not appear to be homogenous across neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with higher employment density and a more diverse land use mix experienced a higher demand shock while mobility and retail performances of those with higher population density were less affected by COVID-19 incidences. Among established retail areas within Seoul, those with higher retail agglomeration were more resilient to the localized shock of COVID-19 case information. Finally, we find neighborhood spillovers effects. An increase in COVID-19 risks in geographically adjacent neighborhoods led to a significant reduction in non-resident in-flow and retail spending in the subject neighborhood. Results provide important implications on the roles of spatial attributes and retail agglomeration to localized economic resilience during and after the pandemic.
