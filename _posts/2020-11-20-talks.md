*ABSTRACT:* During the COVID-19 pandemic, a few countries chose to disclose detailed location information of cases, along with mass testing and contact tracing, rather than a lockdown policy. In this paper, we study public responses to this information by using daily mobility and credit card transaction data in Seoul, South Korea. We first find that the disclosure of COVID-19 cases did help promote voluntary precautionary behavior as both non-resident in-flow and retail spending decreased significantly in neighborhoods with more cases. But, public responses to the disclosed information of cases do not appear to be homogenous across neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with higher employment density and a more diverse land use mix experienced a higher demand shock while mobility and retail performances of those with higher population density were less affected by COVID-19 incidences. Among established retail areas within Seoul, those with higher retail agglomeration were more resilient to the localized shock of COVID-19 case information. Finally, we find neighborhood spillovers effects. An increase in COVID-19 risks in geographically adjacent neighborhoods led to a significant reduction in non-resident in-flow and retail spending in the subject neighborhood. Results provide important implications on the roles of spatial attributes and retail agglomeration to localized economic resilience during and after the pandemic.

- [Shaun Bond*](https://business.uq.edu.au/profile/6239/shaun-bond), [Hui Guo](https://homepages.uc.edu/~guohu/) and [Changyu Yang](): "Do Institutional Investors Trade on Mispricing? Evidence from Real Estate Markets"

*ABSTRACT:* This paper focuses on the relationship between stock prices and net asset values (NAV). By investigating two prevailing sets of proprietary NAV data on asset holdings for real estate investment trusts from Green Street Advisors and S&P Global Market Intelligence (formerly the SNL Financial dataset), we find that stock prices deviate substantially from their NAV. A long-short strategy based on the premium to NAV yields about 1% return per month. Due to the high institutional ownership in public real estate markets, we then exam whether institutional investors are rational and whether they trade against mispricing. The evidence contradicts the sophisticated institutional investor hypothesis. We find that institutional investors tend to buy overvalued stocks and sell undervalued stocks. Furthermore, our results may shed light on popular asset pricing anomalies. By checking the premium to NAV of anomaly portfolios, we conclude that the ranking of momentum and earning surprises can be used as a proxy for mispricing in public real estate markets.
